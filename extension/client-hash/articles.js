      "Three decades on, Greece, Macedonia sign pact to change ex-Yugoslav republic's name",
    text:
      '              By Karolina Tagaris  and Aleksandar Vasovic              PRESPES, Greece/ BITOLA, Macedonia (Reuters) - Greece and Macedonia defied protests and set aside three decades of dispute on Sunday as they agreed on a new name for the Balkan state, potentially paving the way for Macedonia\'s admission to the European Union and NATO.              The foreign ministers of Greece and Macedonia signed an accord to rename the former Yugoslav republic the "Republic of North Macedonia," despite a storm of protest over a deal seen as a national sellout by some on both sides.              In the idyllic setting of Prespes, a lake region that borders Greece, Macedonia and Albania, officials from the two countries embraced, shook hands and penned a deal in the presence of European and United Nations officials.              The agreement still requires the approval of both parliaments and a referendum in Macedonia. That approval is far from assured, as it faces stiff opposition from the Greek public, and Macedonia\'s president has vowed to block the deal.              "We have a historic responsibility that this deal is not held in abeyance, and I am confident that we will manage it," Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said as he and his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev received a standing ovation from guests at the lakeside ceremony.              Tsipras survived a no-confidence vote mounted by Greece\'s opposition in parliament on Saturday, but the depth of public emotion against the deal is strong.              In the Macedonian city of Bitola not far from the Greek border, protesters wrapped in national flags chanted "This is Macedonia" and began to march across the city.              "This shameful deal will not pass, we will defend Macedonia\'s name and pride," said Petre Filipovski, 40, dressed in the trademark red T-thirt of the opposition VMRO-DPMNE party.              In the Greek village of Pisoderi, protesters carried a giant Greek flag and one group clashed with riot police on a mountain slope as they tried to break the cordon. Others chanted the Greek national anthem.              Up to 70 percent of Greeks object to the compromise, an opinion poll by the Proto Thema newspaper showed on Saturday. In Psarades, the tiny lakeside community where the deal was signed, the village church bell tolled in mourning, draped in a Greek flag.              Others might object, too. "One big concern is Russia. Moscow has noticeably refused to endorse the agreement. It knows that this will see Macedonia join NATO," said James Ker-Lindsay, professor of politics and policy at St. Mary\'s University in London.               "There will be fears that Russia may now try to somehow influence the vote," Ker-Lindsay sadi. "Given recent allegations of Moscow’s involvement in other elections and referendums, this will be a real concern for NATO and the EU."               Under the deal, Greece will lift its objections to the renamed nation joining the EU and NATO.               "Our two countries have to turn from the past and look to the future," Zaev said. "We were bold enough to take a step forward."              Greece has been in dispute with Macedonia since 1991 over the former Yugoslav republic\'s name, arguing it could imply territorial claims over the Greek province of Macedonia and an appropriation of ancient Greek culture and civilisation.              The subject is an emotional one for many Greeks. On Saturday, thousands of protesters outside the parliament building shouted "Traitor, traitor!" as lawmakers debated inside.              Veteran UN mediator Matthew Nimetz, who has been overseeing talks for a quarter century, described the agreement as an honourable deal. It was, he said, an example of "how neighbours can solve a problem if they really work at it".              "Today is my birthday," said Nimetz, who turned 79 on Sunday. "I told my family this year I don’t need any gifts because two prime ministers are going to give me a big gift."                                          '

      "Taliban, roaming Afghan cities amid Eid euphoria, rule out ceasefire extension",
    text:
      '              By Rupam  Jain              KABUL (Reuters) - Taliban militants headed into cities across Afghanistan on Sunday as they celebrated their Eid ceasefire with feasts and selfies, raising questions about what happens when the ceasefire ends at midnight.              President Ashraf Ghani said he would extend a government ceasefire on Saturday and urged the Taliban to do the same, garnering praise at home and international backing, but critics said such overtures have allowed the Taliban to pour into cities unchecked and win the upper hand.              But the Taliban said there would be no extension, adding that their members were expected to leave government-controlled areas before sunset.              Ghani had committed "a grave mistake" by allowing Taliban fighters to enter government-controlled areas, said Amarullah Saleh, a politician and former head of the National Directorate of Security.              "We don\'t have mechanisms in place to mitigate the breach of ceasefire by the Taliban," Saleh told Reuters.              Members of parliament opposing Ghani\'s move said he had not consulted politicians and would be left with no recourse if the Taliban rejected his impromptu request.              A senior Western diplomat in Kabul said Ghani\'s decision was "a bold move" but questioned what happens if the Taliban do not extend their unprecedented halt in hostilities against government forces.              "The consequences could be disastrous," he said.              An explosion in Jalalabad, outside the governor\'s office in Nangarhar province, killed at least 15 people on Sunday, an official said.              No group immediately claimed responsibility.              A car bomb killed 36 people at a gathering of Taliban and Afghan armed forces in the same province on Saturday. Islamic State, not covered by the government ceasefire, claimed responsibility.              Over the weekend, ecstatic men and children crowded around the soldiers and Taliban fighters, some of whom had checked in their weapons at the entrances to cities, and urged them to turn their ceasefire into a permanent peace.              Governors and senior government officials hosted small feasts, played music to welcome the militants, coinciding with the close of the month-long Ramadan fasting season.              "There is no intention to extend the ceasefire," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters. "...Our normal operations will start tomorrow (Monday).”               Ghani\'s office has yet to declare a new timeframe for the extended government ceasefire.               Western diplomats based in Kabul said they were issuing fresh travel warnings for the whole country.              "The Taliban can always use a ceasefire as an opportunity to attack foreigners," one Western diplomat said. "Nobody has any clue how many Taliban militants are now hiding in civilian areas."                            PAKISTAN ROLE              U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, echoing Ghani\'s announcement on Saturday, said peace talks would have to include a discussion on the role of "international actors and forces".              "Ghani has full blessings of the U.S. administration and it is crucial for the U.S. officials to prove that (U.S. President Donald) Trump’s policies are working and talks with the Afghan Taliban are imminent," said a senior diplomat who met Afghan officials on Sunday to monitor the chance of back-channel talks with Taliban leaders.              The United States wants Pakistan, which it accuses of harbouring Afghan Taliban commanders, to exert more influence on the group to bring it to the negotiating table.              The only time direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban have been held, in 2015, they broke down almost immediately.              The Taliban are fighting U.S.-led NATO forces, combined under the Resolute Support mission, and Ghani\'s U.S.-backed government to restore sharia, or Islamic law, after their ouster by U.S.-led forces in 2001.              But Afghanistan has been at war for four decades, ever since the Soviet invasion in 1979.              "What we witnessed over the last two days was an overwhelmingly positive response by all Afghans to peace," Lt-Colonel Martin O\'Donnell, a spokesman for Resolute Support and U.S. Forces-Afghanistan, told Reuters.              "Not even the attack on peace yesterday in Nangarhar by the enemies of Afghanistan will slow the nationwide momentum or quiet the celebration of a long-overdue cessation of hostilities and a chance for lasting peace."                On Sunday, Taliban insurgents were travelling freely with their flags and meeting civilians despite curbs imposed after the first Nangarhar attack.              "In order to prevent our countrymen from being harmed and ... we become a reason for that, all officials should ban all mujahideen (Taliban fighters) under their command from participating in such crowds and gatherings," Taliban spokesman Mujahid said.               The Taliban roam huge swaths of the country and, with foreign troop levels of about 15,600, down from 140,000 in 2014, there appears little hope of outright government victory.

      "Pro-EU lawmaker in Britain's Conservative party: 'We could collapse government'",
    text:
      "              LONDON (Reuters) - A leading pro-European Union lawmaker in Britain's ruling Conservative Party warned on Sunday that a row over parliament's influence on the Brexit process could collapse the government, but said he hoped to find a way to avoid that.              Prime Minister Theresa May's minority Conservative government is fighting with rebels from her own party over the final wording of the laws that will end Britain's EU membership -  a bitter row which threatens to undermine her authority.              \"We could collapse the government, and I can assure you I wake up at 2 a.m. in a cold sweat thinking about the problems we have put on our shoulders,\" Dominic Grieve, the lawmaker negotiating with the government, told the BBC.               The minister leading those negotiations, Solicitor General Robert Buckland, said the government was standing by its own proposal, rejected by party rebels last week.              The row centres on what happens if parliament rejects the initial exit deal May and her team negotiate with Brussels.              Grieve and a cohort of potential Conservative rebels with enough votes to defeat the government want parliament to have more influence over the next steps than ministers are prepared to give them.              Negotiations on a compromise, promised last week by May to avert a defeat, fell apart at the last minute on Thursday when rebels said the government had changed the wording of an agreement.              \"The first thing I want to understand is why this has been rejected?\" Grieve said. \"I'd urge (Brexit minister) David Davis ...  (to) go away and look at it and talk to the government's lawyers, and he will be reassured that it doesn't do what he fears.\"              Davis and Prime Minister Theresa May have argued that they cannot accept anything which gives parliament the power to bind their hands in negotiations with the EU, or opens the door to lawmakers overturning the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum.              The rebels' proposal will come up against the government proposal in parliament's unelected upper chamber on Monday, and will then be discussed again in the elected lower house on Wednesday.              Wednesday's debate will be a crucial test of May's ability to either face down the rebellion, or negotiate a way out of trouble at short notice.               For now, Buckland said ministers were happy to stick to their position and see where the debate on Monday took them.              \"Our position is to support the amendment as tabled (proposed) by the government,\" he said. \"Of course we have Tuesday to consider matters ahead of the Wednesday vote.\"              \"We've won every vote last week. I believe we can carry on in that successful vein.\"                              (Reporting by William James; Editing by Jason Neely and Raissa Kasolowsky)                                          "

      "              LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, said on Sunday that his phone had been stolen by moped-riding thieves several months ago and that he was seeking changes to police rules to help tackle the growing problem.              Moped robbery, where attackers surprise pedestrians and grab phones and bags, is one of several violent crimes in London that have attracted national attention. Earlier this year, a spate of stabbings briefly pushed London's murder rate ahead of New York's.                In an interview with the Sun on Sunday newspaper, Javid said he was robbed outside London's Euston station as he went to make a phone call. The incident happened before he took up his job in charge of domestic security.              \"It happened in a flash. I was walking out of Euston station and reached for my phone to call a taxi... before I knew what was happening, it had gone. They just rode up, grabbed it and zoomed off,\" he said.              Javid, seen by some as a potential challenger to Prime Minister Theresa May, was appointed in April after a scandal over the treatment of legal migrants led to the resignation of his predecessor.              Javid said that while overall crime levels were down, he would make tackling rising knife crime and serious violence a priority. He wants to change rules which prevent police from chasing suspects on mopeds if they are not wearing helmets.

    text:
      '              By Mohammed Ghobari              ADEN (Reuters) - A Saudi-led coalition conducted air strikes on Yemen\'s Hodeidah airport on Sunday to support forces trying to seize control from Iran-aligned Houthi fighters, who are facing their biggest challenge in the war, Saudi and Houthi-run media reported.               Warplanes carried out five strikes on the port city of Hodeidah, a lifeline to millions of Yemenis, according to SABA, the official Houthi news agency. Saudi-owned broadcaster Al Arabiya also reported strikes on the airport.              Ground troops, including United Arab Emiratis, Sudanese and Yemenis from various factions, surrounded the main airport compound on Saturday, said a source in the coalition-allied Yemeni military.              The goal of the allies, led by the Emiratis, is to defeat the Houthis in Hodeidah, the only Red Sea port under their control, and cut off their supply lines to the capital, Sanaa.              "We have lived in a state of terror for three days because we are in a neighbourhood close to the airport," said resident Khaled Ateeq, 38.              The battle for Hodeidah could drag on, creating more suffering for civilians, who have endured air strikes, port blockades, hunger and a cholera epidemic.              The Saudi-led coalition has relied heavily on air strikes against the Houthis, who are highly experienced in mountain warfare. The group, which seized Sanaa in 2014, has fought a series of guerrilla wars with Yemen\'s national army and a brief border war with Saudi Arabia.               Its fighters have advanced on sandal-shod feet and by pickup trucks in battles across Yemen. They are more suited than coalition forces for guerrilla warfare should fighting extend to Hodeidah\'s densely populated neighbourhoods.              As the Houthis battled to keep their turf at the airport, Yemenis fighting with the coalition piled into pickup trucks, their cheeks bulging with the narcotic plant qat. They formed a convoy along a road overlooking the desert outside of Hodeidah               Others with AK-47 assault rifles walked in sandals past armoured vehicles and took up positions in the sand. One fighter casually fired mortar bombs into the distance.              Houthis rule the most populous areas of chronically unstable Yemen, where many parties have been competing for territory and influence, from loyalists of the late President Ali Abdullah Saleh to southern separatists to al-Qaeda.              The United Nations says the assault on Hodeidah could trigger a famine imperilling millions of lives. Residents who can\'t make ends meet are bracing for more hardship as both sides engage in the most strategic battle of a war of attrition that has killed more than 10,000 people.              Yehia Sohail had occasionally found work at Hodeidah’s port. He fears that source of income could soon vanish.               "I take the money to cover the needs of one day and that’s it, it’s done," he said, speaking outside his shack, built from corrugated metal, palm fronds and torn blankets.              "Now if the port closes, where will I go to work? When this siege comes and this disaster happens, where am I going to find work?"              His wife, Um Ahmed, said the family had no cooking gas. A motorcycle, their only means of transportation, had broken down. Sometimes strong rains and wind tore down their tiny home.              "I have a young daughter who’s exhausted and sick and we can’t get her medication or anything, only the necessary food. If a war happens, what are we going to do?" she said.              Riyadh has accused the Houthis of using the port to smuggle Iranian-made weapons, including missiles used to target Saudi cities -- accusations denied by the group and Tehran. The Houthis deny being pawns of Iran and  say they are fighting to evict foreign occupiers from Yemen.              Residents said Houthi fighters dug a large ditch at the northern entrance to Hodeidah to prevent coalition forces from advancing towards Sanaa. People in al-Rubasah neighbourhood near the airport, meanwhile, said bullets were striking their homes.

    title: "Timeline - Yemen's slide into political crisis and war",
    text:
      "              (Reuters) - The battle for the port of Hodeidah could become a turning point in Yemen's civil war. The following is a timeline of the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country's slide into violence and how the conflict has developed. [L8N1TJ05M]                            * 1990. Unification of north and south Yemen to form a single state under president Ali Abdullah Saleh.                            * 1994. Civil war in which Saleh prevents south, angered by what it sees as lower status, from splitting with north.                            * 2003-09. Houthi group in north protests marginalisation of the local Zaydi Shi'ite Muslim sect and fights six wars with Saleh's forces and one with Saudi Arabia.                            * 2011. Arab Spring protests undermine Saleh's rule, lead to splits in the army and allow al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to seize swathes of territory in the east.                             * 2012. Saleh steps down in a political transition plan backed by Gulf states. Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi becomes interim president and oversees a \"national dialogue\" to draft a more inclusive, federal constitution.                             * 2013. AQAP survives military onslaught and drone strikes, staging attacks across the country while retaining a persistent presence. Saleh and his allies undermine the political transition.                             * 2014. The Houthis rapidly advance south from Saadeh and seize Sanaa on September 21 with help from Saleh. They demand a share in power.                             * 2015. Hadi tries to announce a new federal constitution opposed by the Houthis and Saleh, who arrest him. He escapes, pursued by the Houthis, triggering Saudi intervention in March along with a hastily assembled Arab military coalition.               Months later, the coalition drives the Houthis and Saleh loyalists from Aden in south Yemen and Marib, northeast of Sanaa, but the front lines solidify, setting up years of stalemate.                             * 2016. AQAP takes advantage of the chaos to establish a mini-state around Mukalla in east Yemen, raising fears the war will lead to a new surge in jihadist activity. The UAE backs local forces in a battle to end the group's rule there.               Hunger grows as the coalition imposes a partial blockade on Yemen, accusing Iran of smuggling missiles to the Houthis through Hodeidah alongside food imports, something it denies.                Coalition air strikes that kill civilians prompt warnings from rights groups, but Western support for the military campaign continues.                             * 2017. The Houthis launch a growing number of missiles deep into Saudi Arabia, including at Riyadh.

      '              By Luis Felipe Fernandez and Jordi Rubio              VALENCIA, Spain (Reuters) - A migrant rescue boat turned away by Italy and Malta arrived at the Spanish port of Valencia on Sunday, ending a gruelling voyage which has made it a symbol of Europe\'s failure to agree on immigration.              Spain swooped to help 629 mainly sub-Saharan Africans on board the Aquarius last week after Italy\'s new government,  asserting its anti-immigrant credentials, refused to let it dock. Spain\'s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who took office two weeks ago, took the opportunity to show a more liberal stance.              But the plight of the Aquarius, run by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) with Franco-German charity SOS Mediterranee, highlighted the European Union\'s failure to agree on how to manage the huge influx of people fleeing poverty and conflict.                 In Valencia, officials in white protective suits and masks greeted the migrants as they debarked and police started identifying them and processing their information.              The Aquarius arrived carrying 106 people rescued from unstable boats near Libya. The others had been transferred to an Italian coast guard vessel and a ship belonging to the Italian navy to make the journey safer.              The coast guard boat was the first to arrive, docking in the eastern port with 274 on board just after dawn.              Shouts and singing erupted on the ship as the migrants on board saw Valencia on the horizon, Spanish journalist Gabriela Sanchez tweeted from another boat travelling alongside it.               A staff of 2,320, including volunteers, translators and health officials, were waiting on shore. Red Cross Secretary General Elhadj As Sy was also in Valencia for the arrival.              "This sad odyssey of the people on the Aquarius is another reminder that all people, regardless of their nationality or immigration status, should have access to basic assistance and protection," Sy said in a statement.              "No human being is \'illegal\', and people who need help should receive help," added Sy.                            "CALM AND PLEASED"               Doctors Without Borders tweeted a photo of one of its team telling the people on board what they could expect.              "People are calm and pleased to be arriving in Spain," the group said.              All seven pregnant women on board the ships will be immediately taken for check-ups, and all the arrivals, including 123 minors, will receive psychological help.              Valencian local government officials said none of the people who arrived on the first boat showed signs of serious illness, but many had suffered from crowded conditions and high temperatures in recent days.              Anti-migrant feeling has surged in Italy, where more than 600,000 people have arrived by sea over the past five years, helping to propel the nationalist League into a coalition government.               Far fewer have come to Spain, but the numbers are rising fast. Spain\'s coast guard rescued almost 1,000 people on Friday and Saturday. A search is underway off the coast of Almeria after four sub-Saharan men rescued by helicopter said their dinghy had been carrying a total 47 people when it sank.              Most Spaniards support the idea of welcoming and helping to integrate refugees, pollsters say. That allowed Sanchez, a socialist, to offer migrant-friendly policies to voters who felt previous governments did not do enough.              France, which chided Italy for turning away the Aquarius, has offered to take in any passengers who qualify for asylum and want to go there.                      An Italian naval vessel is due to bring the remaining migrants into port later in the morning.

"We could collapse the government, and I can assure you I wake up at 2 a.m. in a cold sweat thinking about the problems we have put on our shoulders," said Dominic Grieve, the lawmaker negotiating with the government on the final wording of the laws that will end Britain\'s European Union membership.

    title: "Facing coalition crisis, Merkel seeks migrant talks with EU states",
    text:
      '              By Madeline Chambers              BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking talks with some EU member states on migrant policy before a leaders summit at the end of the month, a government spokesman said, in a last-ditch bid to avert a coalition crisis erupting this week.              The spokesman denied a report in Bild newspaper that Merkel was trying to arrange a special summit on migrant policy, saying such a meeting would be a matter for EU institutions.              "But of course the German government is having talks in this regard with several member states and the (European) Commission," government spokesman Steffen Seibert tweeted.               EU states are deeply divided on how to deal with large numbers of people fleeing conflict, especially from the Middle East. The issue has come to a head in the last week with a new Italian government refusing to let a ship with hundreds of migrants dock at its ports. The ship arrived in Spain on Sunday.              Time for a deal is pressing for Merkel, at loggerheads with her conservative Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU), who share power with her Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Social Democrats in a loveless coalition.              In an extraordinary move, the CSU - facing a tough regional election in October - has threatened to defy her and on Monday go ahead with plans for Germany to send back migrants already registered in other EU states.               This unilateral approach, a reversal of her 2015 open-door policy, would undermine Merkel\'s authority and be a blow to the EU\'s Schengen open-border system.              Such a direct challenge to Merkel would force her to fire Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, a Bavarian who has long been a thorn in her side on migrant policy.               There is even talk that the 70-year-old conservative parliamentary alliance between the CDU and CSU could collapse.                            \'DON\'T WANT TO BLOW UP COALITION\'               Seehofer told Bild am Sonntag newspaper: "No one in the CSU has an interest in bringing down the chancellor, to break up the CDU/CSU parliamentary alliance or to blow up the coalition."              However, in terms of substance, he showed no sign of shifting his position. "We want a solution for sending back refugees at our borders," he said. Two other leading CSU members said they wanted to start implementing the policy quickly.              Merkel has asked the CSU to give her two weeks to come up with bilateral deals with some countries, such as Italy and Greece, similar to one agreed between Turkey and the EU in 2016.               Former Bavarian premier Guenther Beckstein suggested on Saturday that one way out might be for Germany to agree to the CSU policy but to implement it only after the EU summit, to give Merkel time to deliver her "European solution".              Growing numbers of leading CDU figures, most of whom do not want to see Merkel fall even if they prefer the CSU\'s tough stance on migrants, have called for the two to settle their differences.              CDU General Secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, widely seen as Merkel\'s preferred successor, said the two parties agreed on the aim of minimising the number of migrants registered elsewhere and coming to Germany but disagreed on how to achieve it.              "Our hand is still outstretched to the CSU," she told Bild am Sonntag.

Spain swooped to help 629 mainly sub-Saharan Africans on board the Aquarius last week, offering the charity-run ship a berth 700 nautical miles away after Italy and Malta refused to let it dock.              The first migrants to arrive came on an Italian coast guard ship, which took aboard 274 of the Aquarius\'s passengers to make the journey safer. They arrived soon after dawn in the eastern Spanish port, where a staff of 2,320, including volunteers, translators and health officials, awaited.                Officials in white protective suits and masks greeted the migrants as they debarked and took them to a tent where police started identifying them and processing their information.              The Aquarius itself is due to dock once all the migrants are off the Italian vessel. Shouts and singing erupted on the ship as the 106 migrants on board saw Valencia on the horizon, Spanish journalist Gabriela Sanchez tweeted. Sanchez was travelling on another rescue group\'s boat alongside it.               The ship\'s predicament gave Italy\'s new government the chance to assert its anti-immigrant credentials, and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, in office for just over a week, took the opportunity to underline a more liberal stance.

      "Taliban roaming Afghan cities at will, raising fears amid Eid euphoria",
    text:
      '              By Rupam  Jain              KABUL (Reuters) - Taliban militants headed into cities across Afghanistan on Sunday as they continued to celebrate their Eid ceasefire with feasts and selfies, raising questions about what happens when the ceasefire ends at midnight.              President Ashraf Ghani extended a government ceasefire on Saturday and urged the Taliban to do the same, garnering praise at home and international backing, but critics said such overtures have allowed the Taliban to pour into cities unchecked and win the upper hand.              Ghani had committed "a grave mistake" by allowing Taliban fighters to enter government-controlled areas, said Amarullah Saleh, a politician and a former head of the National Directorate of Security.              "We don\'t have mechanisms in place to mitigate the breach of ceasefire by the Taliban," Saleh told Reuters.              Members of parliament opposing Ghani\'s move said he had not consulted politicians and would be left with no recourse if the Taliban rejected his impromptu request.              A senior western diplomat in Kabul said Ghani\'s decision was "a bold move" but questioned what happens if the Taliban do not extend their unprecedented halt in hostilities against government forces.              "The consequences could be disastrous," he said.              Over the weekend, ecstatic men and children crowded around the soldiers and Taliban fighters, some of whom had checked in their weapons at the entrances to cities, and urged them to turn their ceasefire into a permanent peace.              Governors and senior government officials hosted small feasts, played music to welcome the militants\' ceasefire, coinciding with the close of the month-long Ramadan fasting season.              "So far, no decision has been made for the extension of the ceasefire, so today is the last day of our three-day truce," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.              "Our normal operations will start tomorrow (Monday).”               Ghani\'s office has yet to declare a new timeframe for the extended ceasefire.               Members of Afghanistan\'s High Peace Council supported the decision and urged the Taliban, whose numbers on the streets of Kabul and other cities are impossible to calculate, to extend their ceasefire.              "Good steps for peace have been taken, but more steps have to be taken," said council chairman Karim Khalili.              U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, echoing Ghani\'s remarks, said peace talks would have to include a discussion on the role of "international actors and forces".                            PAKISTAN ROLE              "Ghani has full blessings of the U.S. administration and it is crucial for the U.S. officials to prove that Trump’s policies are working and talks with the Afghan Taliban are imminent," said a senior diplomat who met Afghan officials on Sunday to monitor the chance of back-channel talks with Taliban leaders.              The United States wants Pakistan, which it accuses of harbouring Afghan Taliban commanders, to exert more influence on the group to bring it to the negotiating table.              The only time direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban have been held, in 2015, they broke down almost immediately.              The Taliban are fighting U.S.-led NATO forces, combined under the Resolute Support mission, and Ghani\'s U.S.-backed government to restore sharia, or Islamic law, after their ouster by U.S.-led forces in 2001. Resolute Support did not immediately respond to a request for comment.              But Afghanistan has been at war for four decades, ever since the Soviet invasion in 1979.              A car bomb killed 36 people at a gathering of Taliban and Afghan armed forces in the eastern city of Nangarhar on Saturday. Islamic State claimed responsibility.              On Sunday, Taliban insurgents were travelling freely with their flags and meeting civilians despite curbs imposed after the Nangarhar attack.              "In order to prevent our countrymen from being harmed and... we become a reason for that, all officials should ban all mujahideen (Taliban fighters) under their command from participating in such crowds and gatherings," Taliban spokesman Mujahid said.               The Taliban already roam huge swaths of the country and, with foreign troop levels of about 15,600, down from 140,000 in 2014, there appears little hope of outright government victory.              For now the atmosphere is festive - a story doing the rounds on social media is that one Talib, after hugging Kabul residents, asked for directions to Baharistan, to the west of Kabul.              "I have heard there is very good ice cream there," he said.

      '              By Karolina Tagaris               PRESPES, Greece (Reuters) - Greece and Macedonia defied protests and set aside decades of dispute on Sunday as they agreed on a new name for the Balkan state, potentially paving the way for Skopje\'s admission to the EU and NATO.              The foreign ministers of Greece and Macedonia signed an accord to rename the former Yugoslav republic the "Republic of North Macedonia," despite a storm of protest over a deal seen as a national sellout by some on both sides.              In the idyllic setting of Prespes, a lake region which borders Greece, Macedonia and Albania, officials from the two countries embraced, shook hands and penned a deal in the presence of European and United Nations officials.              The agreement still requires the approval of both parliaments and a referendum in Macedonia. That approval is far from assured, as it faces stiff opposition from the Greek public, and Macedonia\'s president has vowed to block the deal.              "We have a historic responsibility that this deal is not held in abeyance, and I am confident that we will manage it," Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said as he and his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev received a standing ovation from guests at the lakeside ceremony.              Tsipras survived a no-confidence vote mounted by Greece\'s opposition in parliament on Saturday, but the depth of public emotion against the deal is strong.               Up to 70 percent of Greeks object to the compromise, an opinion poll by the Proto Thema newspaper showed on Saturday. In Psarades, the tiny lakeside community where the deal was signed, the village church bell tolled in mourning, draped in a Greek flag.              Under the deal, Greece will lift its objections to the renamed nation joining the EU and NATO.               "Our two countries have to turn from the past and look to the future," Zaev said. "We were bold enough to take a step forward."              Greece has been in dispute with Macedonia since 1991 over the former Yugoslav republic\'s name, arguing it could imply territorial claims over the Greek province of Macedonia and an appropriation of ancient Greek culture and civilisation.              The subject is an emotional one for many Greeks. On Saturday, thousands of protesters outside the parliament building shouted "Traitor, traitor!" as lawmakers debated inside.              Veteran UN mediator Matthew Nimetz, who has been overseeing talks for a quarter century, described the agreement as an honourable deal. It was, he said, an example of "how neighbours can solve a problem if they really work at it".              "Today is my birthday," said Nimetz, who turned 79 on Sunday. "I told my family this year I don’t need any gifts because two prime ministers are going to give me a big gift."

    title: "May pledges 20 billion extra pounds for healthcare post-Brexit",
    text:
      '              By William James and Estelle Shirbon              LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May pledged on Sunday to increase funding for the National Health Service by 20 billion pounds after Brexit, funded by money no longer spent on membership of the European Union and possible tax rises.              The announcement of more cash for the NHS, a regular issue at elections, comes after a row in parliament over Brexit highlighted the fragility of May\'s minority government.              May said spending in England would increase to an extra 20 billion pounds by 2023/24. The pledge drew immediate scepticism, with critics saying the plans lacked detail and questioning whether leaving the EU would actually save money.              "As we leave the European Union and stop paying significant annual subscriptions to Brussels, we will have more money to spend on priorities like the NHS," May said in a post on her Facebook account.              "But to give the NHS the funding it needs for the future, this Brexit dividend will not be enough.  As a country, we need to contribute a bit more in a fair and balanced way."              May said the spending increase was equivalent to a 3.4 percent funding increase in real terms. Independent experts say it needs even more than that to improve.              The idea of a "Brexit dividend" is also contested. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank highlighted government analysis showing public finances would weaken by 15 billion pounds per year after Brexit, and paying Britain\'s EU divorce bill would eat up any savings initially.              In media interviews, May said her finance minister would set out plans before a government spending review expected next year. She said the increased contribution from taxpayers would be done in a "fair and balanced" way. She did not answer directly when asked whether borrowing might increase.              The announcement is timed to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS, which delivers free access to care for everyone living in Britain. It aims to foster unity in the government and the country after two years of bitter divisions over Brexit.              But it is also seen as a political risk. During eight years in power, May\'s Conservative Party has made fiscal discipline its core message. Any departure that involves tax increases could upset core voters and open it up to criticism from the opposition Labour Party.              "I\'d certainly welcome it, if I could believe it," Labour\'s foreign affairs spokeswoman Emily Thornberry told the BBC. "Let\'s see what they deliver. How are they going to pay for it?"                            TAILORED MESSAGE              Sunday\'s announcement was also tailored to send a positive message to the 48 percent of Britons who voted in 2016 to remain in the EU - many of whom are still unconvinced about Brexit as the March 29, 2019 exit date approaches.              During the 2016 referendum campaign on EU membership, the pro-Brexit camp claimed that Britain was sending 350 million pounds a week to the EU and should spend that money on the NHS instead.              The claim was controversial because the figure did not take into account Britain\'s sizeable rebate or the payments that were flowing back from the EU to Britain, so it was widely seen as overstating Britain\'s contribution to the bloc.              Despite leaving, Britain will continue to make payments to the EU over several decades to settle an exit bill of around 39 billion pounds.              In interviews, May - who campaigned against Brexit in 2016 and has been under pressure from hardline Brexiteers ever since to prove her conversion to the cause - drew attention to the fact that her funding announcement exceeded that 350 million pound-per-week figure.              Twenty billion pounds annually is approximately 384 million pounds per week.

      '              By Karolina Tagaris               PRESPES, Greece (Reuters) - The foreign ministers of Greece and Macedonia signed an accord on Sunday to rename the former Yugoslav republic the "Republic of North Macedonia."              The landmark accord follows decades of inconclusive talks which had soured relations between the two countries and held up the admission of the Balkan state into the EU and NATO, of which Greece is a member.              The agreement still requires the approval of both parliaments and a referendum in Macedonia.              "We have a historic responsibility that this deal is not held in abeyance, and I am confident that we will manage it," Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said as he and his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev received a standing ovation from guests at a lakeside ceremony.              Tsipras survived a no-confidence vote mounted by Greece\'s opposition in parliament on Saturday, but the depth of public emotion against the deal is strong.               Up to 70 percent of Greeks object to the compromise, an opinion poll by the Proto Thema newspaper showed on Saturday.              Under the deal, Greece will lift its objections to the renamed nation joining the EU and NATO.               "Our two countries have to turn from the past and look to the future," Zaev said. "We were bold enough to take a step forward."              Greece has been in dispute with Macedonia since 1991 over the former Yugoslav republic\'s name, arguing it could imply territorial claims over the Greek province of Macedonia and an appropriation of ancient Greek culture and civilisation.              The subject is an emotional one for many Greeks. On Saturday, thousands of protesters outside the parliament building shouted "Traitor, traitor!" as lawmakers debated inside.

    title: "May pledges 20 billion extra pounds for healthcare post-Brexit",
    text:
      '              LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May pledged on Sunday to increase funding for the National Health Service (NHS) by 20 billion pounds after Brexit, partly from tax hikes and partly from money that will no longer be going to the European Union.              The announcement of more cash for the country\'s healthcare system, a regular issue at national elections, comes after a row in parliament over Brexit highlighted the fragility of May\'s minority government.              "By the end of five years, in 2023/24, the NHS will be getting 20 billion pounds more in real terms that year, than it is today," May said in a pre-recorded interview for LBC Radio broadcast on Sunday.              "We take the advantage that we\'ve got of the money we\'re no longer sending to the European Union, but also in putting the amount of money we want to put into the NHS for the future, I think we do have to look at contributing more."              Asked about tax increase, May said her finance minister  would set out plans before a government spending review expected next year. She said the increased contribution from taxpayers would be done in a "fair and balanced" way.              The announcement is timed to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS, which delivers free access to care for everyone living in Britain. It aims to foster unity in the government and the country after two years of bitter divisions over Brexit.              It was also tailored to send a positive message to the 48 percent of Britons who in 2016 wanted to remain in the EU - many of whom are still unconvinced about Brexit as the March 29, 2019 exit date approaches.              During the 2016 referendum campaign on EU membership, the pro-Brexit camp claimed that Britain was sending 350 million pounds a week to the EU and should spend that money on the NHS instead.              The claim was controversial because the figure did not take into account Britain\'s sizeable rebate or the payments that were flowing back from the EU to Britain, so it was widely seen as overstating Britain\'s contribution to the bloc.              Despite leaving, Britain will continue to make payments to the EU over several decades to settle an exit bill of around 39 billion pounds.              In her interview, May - who campaigned against Brexit in 2016 and has been under pressure from hardline Brexiteers ever since to prove her conversion to the cause - drew attention to the fact that her funding announcement exceeded that 350 million pound-per-week figure.              Twenty billion pounds annually is approximately 384 million pounds per week.              Jeremy Hunt, the health minister, who also campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU, was quoted by the Sunday Telegraph as saying that the new pledge "can now unite us all."

    title: "Taliban head into Afghan cities, raising fears amid Eid euphoria",
    text:
      '              By Rupam  Jain              KABUL (Reuters) - Taliban militants headed into cities across Afghanistan on Sunday as they celebrate their unprecedented Eid ceasefire, raising questions about what happens should the hugs and selfies stop and the festive atmosphere and calls for peace turn sour.              President Ashraf Ghani extended the government ceasefire on Saturday, garnering praise at home and international backing, but critics said such overtures have allowed the Taliban to pour into cities unchecked and win the upper hand.              Ecstatic men and children crowded around the soldiers and Taliban fighters, some who had checked in their weapons at the entrances to cities, over the weekend and urged them to extend their ceasefire into a permanent peace.              Governors and senior government officials hosted small feasts, played music to welcome the Taliban after they announced a three-day ceasefire over Eid, marking the close of the month-long Ramadan fasting season that ends on Sunday.              Ghani, in an address to the nation, urged the Taliban to extend their ceasefire and begin peace talks. He said he wanted to discuss "issues of mutual concern with neighbouring countries and the presence of foreign forces".              His office has yet to declare a new timeframe for the extended ceasefire.               A senior western diplomat in Kabul said Ghani\'s decision was "a bold move" but questioned what would happen if the Taliban rejected the fresh ceasefire request.              "The consequences could be disastrous," he said.              Members of Afghanistan\'s High Peace Council supported the decision and urged the Taliban to extend their ceasefire.              "Good steps for peace have been taken, but more steps have to be taken," said council chairman Karim Khalili.                U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, echoing Ghani\'s remarks, said peace talks would have to include a discussion on the role of "international actors and forces".              In August, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled a more hawkish military approach to Afghanistan, including a surge in air strikes, aimed at forcing the Taliban to the negotiating table.              "Ghani has full blessings of the U.S. administration and it is crucial for the U.S. officials to prove that Trump’s policies are working and talks with the Afghan Taliban are imminent," said a senior diplomat who met Afghan officials on Sunday to monitor the chance of back-channel talks with Taliban leaders.              The United States wants Pakistan, which it accuses of harbouring Afghan Taliban commanders, to exert more influence on the group to bring it to the negotiating table.              The only time direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban have been held, in 2015, they broke down almost immediately.              The Taliban are fighting U.S.-led NATO forces, combined under the Resolute Support mission, and Ghani\'s U.S.-backed government to restore sharia, or Islamic law, after their ouster by U.S.-led forces in 2001.              But Afghanistan has been at war for four decades, ever since the Soviet invasion in 1979.              A car bomb killed 36 people at a gathering of Taliban and Afghan armed forces in the eastern city of Nangarhar on Saturday. Islamic State claimed responsibility.              On Sunday, Taliban insurgents were travelling freely with their flags and meeting civilians despite curbs imposed on their movement after Islamic State militants targeted the gathering.              "In order to prevent our countrymen from being harmed and... we become a reason for that, all officials should ban all mujahideen (Taliban fighters) under their command from participating in such crowds and gatherings," said Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman.               Ghani had committed "a grave mistake" by allowing Taliban fighters to enter government-controlled areas, said Amarullah Saleh, a politician and a former head of the National Directorate of Security (NDS).              "We don\'t have mechanisms in place to mitigate the breach of ceasefire by the Taliban," Saleh told Reuters.              Members of parliament opposing Ghani\'s move said he had not consulted politicians and would be left with no recourse if the Taliban rejected his impromptu request.              The Taliban already roam huge swaths of the country and, with foreign troop levels of about 15,600, down from 140,000 in 2014, there appears little hope of outright government victory.              For now the atmosphere is festive - a story doing the rounds on social media is that one Talib, after hugging Kabul residents, asked for directions to Baharistan, to the west of Kabul.              "I have heard there is very good ice cream there," he said.

    text:
      "              LONDON (Reuters) - A division of Germany's Siemens &lt;SIEGn.DE&gt; has been awarded a contract worth about 1.5 billion pounds to design and build 94 new trains for the Piccadilly Line on London's metropolitan train network, known as the Tube.              Transport for London (TfL), the public body in charge of the Tube, said the award of the contract would allow Siemens Mobility Limited to push ahead with its plan to build a new factory in Goole, east Yorkshire, in northern England.              \"The Siemens Mobility Limited factory would employ up to 700 people in skilled engineering and manufacturing roles, plus up to an additional 250 people during the construction phase of the factory,\" TfL said in a statement.              \"As a result, around 1,700 indirect jobs would be created throughout the UK supply chain,\" it said.              Siemens said in March it had leased 67 acres (27 hectares) of land in Goole with a view to building a 200-million-pound  ($266-million) train factory. The plans were subject to the company's success in securing major future orders, it said at the time.              Siemens Mobility Limited is Siemens's British subsidiary for its trains and transport technology business.              TfL said it had also received bids from a joint venture of Canada's Bombardier &lt;BBDb.TO&gt; and Japan's Hitachi &lt;6501.T&gt; and from France's Alstom &lt;ALSO.PA&gt; when the bidding process began in 2016.              Subsequently, Siemens and Alstom announced that their rail businesses were due to be merged.               While the order is for an initial 94 trains for the Piccadilly Line, TfL said the contract was being awarded on the expectation that the manufacturer would also build trains of the same design for three other so-called Deep Tube lines.               The Piccadilly Line, which carries more than 700,000 passengers per day, is the first of the four Deep Tube lines to receive a much-needed upgrade.              The new trains, expected to be delivered from 2023, will be 6 metres (yards) longer than the existing ones and will be designed to optimise space within the constraints of the narrow Deep Tube tunnels.              The 86 trains currently running on the Piccadilly Line were introduced in 1975 and had a design life of 40 years. They are now one of the oldest train fleets in passenger service in Britain.              The ageing trains and signalling system restrict the current rush hour service on the Piccadilly Line to 24 trains per hour. That will go up to 27 trains at peak times by the end of 2026, after the new trains are brought into service, TfL said.              Combined with a signalling upgrade and the purchase of additional trains, peak period capacity on the busiest central sections of the Piccadilly Line will increase by more than half by the end of the 2020s, meaning an additional 21,000 customers will be able to board trains every hour at rush hour.              \"This long-term sustainable investment will support London's growing population, which is set to increase to 10.8 million by 2041, supporting new jobs, homes and growth,\" it said.              Sabrina Soussan, CEO of Siemens Mobility, said the company was thrilled by the announcement.              \"We can drive down lifecycle costs and significantly improve the passenger experience,\" she was quoted as saying by TfL.

      '              VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria called on Germany to fully clarify allegations that German intelligence agents systematically spied on politicians, international organisations and companies on Austrian territory, as reported by two newspapers on Saturday.                Between 1999 and 2006, Germany\'s federal intelligence service BND spied on around 2,000 targets at political institutions, international organisations, banks, companies and weapons producers in Austria, said daily Der Standard and weekly Profil.               "There must be no such thing among friendly states," said Chancellor Sebastian Kurz at a news conference in Vienna, which was also attended by Austria\'s President Alexander van der Bellen.              "Our wish is of course to know who was monitored, when the surveillance was ended, and of course we want to have certainty that it was stopped," Kurz said.              Allegations that Germany\'s intelligence services helped the Americans spy on European officials and firms first surfaced in 2014, and Austria filed a legal complaint a year later.               But the sheer extent of spying activities, if verified, was new, Kurz said.                  The chancellor said his government had been in contact with the German authorities and that they seemed to be willing to cooperate.               "We are confident that Germany is willing to clarify the allegations and create transparency," he said, adding there was currently no indication that the spying continued after 2006.               Der Standard and Profil said their information was based on BND files, which were given to them by a German source.               They analysed a list, that named roughly 2,000 targets, among them the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.S. and Iranian embassies, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as well as Austrian ministries, banks, companies and news agency APA, they said.              Germany\'s BND was not immediately available for comment.                      Austria itself plans to overhaul its main domestic intelligence agency after a controversy in which the far-right interior minister was accused by political opponents of trying to purge its ranks.              That led Germany to fear that intelligence they had given to Austria might have been compromised.

      '              By Michele Kambas and Lefteris Papadimas              ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras survived a no-confidence motion in parliament on Saturday, setting the stage for the signing of a historic accord with neighbouring Macedonia to settle a long dispute over the latter\'s name.              The motion brought by the opposition New Democracy party was rejected by 153 MPs, with 127 in favour. Political opponents had accused Tsipras of making too many concessions over the deal, due to be signed on Sunday.              Thousands of Greeks protested outside parliament against the accord with Macedonia, calling for Tsipras to resign. Police used stun grenades and tear gas to prevent them from entering the building.              "This is a deal I believe that every Greek prime minister would want," Tsipras told the chamber earlier.              Had he lost, the leftist elected in 2015 would have had to relinquish his mandate to the country\'s president, signalling early elections. He is already trailing centre-right New Democracy in opinion polls.              Greece had been in dispute with Macedonia since 1991 over the former Yugoslav republic\'s name, arguing it could imply territorial claims over the Greek province of Macedonia and an appropriation of ancient Greek culture and civilization.              The subject is a deeply emotional one for many Greeks. On Saturday, protesters outside the parliament building shouted "traitor, traitor!" as lawmakers debated inside.               "I\'m just furious," said Theologos Ambotis, 69, a monk. "Conceding on the name is conceding on territory. Macedonia and Alexander the Great is Greek history and culture, and they are just giving it away to Skopje."              Under the terms of the accord, the country will be known as "Republic of North Macedonia" and Greece will lift its objections to the renamed nation joining the European Union and the NATO military alliance.                             ACCORD TO BE SIGNED              Greek foreign minister Nikos Kotzias and his Macedonian counterpart Nikola Dimitrov will sign the pact in the border lake region of Prespes on Sunday morning. Tsipras and Macedonian premier Zoran Zaev will also be present.              It will require ratification by both national parliaments and approval in a Macedonian referendum, which is not assured.              The president of Macedonia has said he will not endorse the pact, while in Greece, Tsipras\'s right-wing coalition partners have said their lawmakers will reject it when it is brought for ratification. That is expected to occur by the end of the year.              Protests were scheduled on both sides of the border on Sunday.              One lawmaker with the right-wing Independent Greeks, Tsipras\'s coalition partner, sided with New Democracy on the motion, bringing applause from opposition politicians. He was promptly expelled by the party\'s leader.               The expulsion brings Tsipras\'s majority in parliament to 153 MPs out of a total in the chamber of 300.              New Democracy leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis called the accord an affront, and the Tsipras government a \'nightmare\'.              "This government should go before it does more damage, this time national damage," he said.

    text:
      '              By Luis Felipe Fernandez and Jordi Rubio              VALENCIA, Spain (Reuters) - Hundreds of migrants pulled from the Mediterranean by a rescue ship arrived at the Spanish port of Valencia on Sunday, ending a gruelling nine-day voyage but leaving wide open a fierce debate in Europe over how to handle immigration.              Spain swooped to help 629 mainly sub-Saharan Africans on board the Aquarius last week, offering the charity-run ship a berth 700 nautical miles away after Italy and Malta refused to let it dock.              The first migrants to arrive came on an Italian coast guard ship, which took aboard 274 of the Aquarius\'s passengers to make the journey safer. They arrived soon after dawn in the eastern Spanish port, where a staff of 2,320, including volunteers, translators and health officials, awaited.                Officials in white protective suits and masks greeted the migrants as they debarked and took them to a tent where police started identifying them and processing their information.              The Aquarius itself is due to dock once all the migrants are off the Italian vessel. Shouts and singing erupted on the ship as the 106 migrants on board saw Valencia on the horizon, Spanish journalist Gabriela Sanchez tweeted. Sanchez was travelling on another rescue group\'s boat alongside it.               The ship\'s predicament gave Italy\'s new government the chance to assert its anti-immigrant credentials, and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, in office for just over a week, took the opportunity to underline a more liberal stance.               But the plight of the Aquarius has highlighted the European Union\'s failure to agree on how to manage huge numbers of people fleeing poverty and conflict.                    "People are coming to Europe seeking European values of solidarity and support," Red Cross Secretary General Elhadj As Sy told a news conference in Valencia on Saturday. "Anything less than that is a betrayal (of) Europe itself."               Doctors Without Borders (MSF) which runs the Aquarius with Franco-German charity SOS Mediterranee, tweeted a photo of one of its team telling the people on board what they could expect.              "People are calm and pleased to be arriving in Spain," the group said.              The seven pregnant women on board the ships are to be immediately taken for check-ups, and all the arrivals, including 123 minors, will receive psychological help, Spanish Red Cross officials said.                    Anti-migrant feeling has surged in Italy, where more than 600,000 people have arrived by sea over the past five years, helping to propel the nationalist League into a coalition government. Far fewer have come to Spain, but the numbers are rising fast.              Most Spaniards support the idea of welcoming and helping to integrate refugees, pollsters say. That allowed Sanchez, a socialist, to offer migrant-friendly policies to voters who felt previous governments did not do enough.              France, which chided Italy for turning away the Aquarius, has offered to take in any passengers who qualify for asylum and want to go there.                      An Italian naval vessel is due to bring the remaining migrants into port later in the morning.

      "Colombia votes in polarised election putting peace, economy at stake",
    text:
      '              By Steven Grattan and Helen Murphy              BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombians vote on Sunday in a deeply divisive presidential runoff that pits candidates offering polar opposite views and has stirred fears the winner will upset a fragile peace process or derail the economy.               Ivan Duque, the business-friendly protégé of hardline former president Alvaro Uribe, wants to alter a peace deal he deems too lenient on Marxist FARC rebels, while keeping Colombia\'s largely orthodox economic model.              His rival, leftist former guerrilla Gustavo Petro, has pledged to take on political elites, redistribute land to the poor and gradually eliminate the need for oil and coal in Latin America\'s fourth-largest economy.               "We\'re between a rock and a hard place," said financial planner Juan Jose Mojica, 21. "They\'re two extremes that could destroy the development that the country has made over the last years."              From the sweltering Caribbean coast to the frigid heights of the Andes, some 11,230 polling stations will open at 1300 GMT. Polls close at 2100 GMT and results are expected within hours.              These are the first elections since a 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which ended their part in a five-decade conflict that has killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions.              Duque wants to change the accord with tougher punishments for FARC war crimes, while Petro promises to support the existing deal and continue a peace process with the National Liberation Army (ELN) - Colombia\'s last active rebel group.              "Duque doesn\'t want peace. He wants war to continue and prevent Colombia getting ahead," said Jorge Andres Sanchez, 31, selling World Cup goods in a Bogota shopping centre. "Let\'s put it behind us and start again."              A lot is at stake too for Colombia\'s $324 billion (244 billion pounds) economy. Duque has promised to keep investors happy by cutting business taxes, bolstering the oil and coal sectors - top exports - and helping manufacturing.              Petro, a one-time member of the now defunct M19 insurgent group, wants a new economic model that ditches reliance on extractive industries for renewable energy and a land reform that promotes an increase in productive use.              His policies have prompted rivals to compare him to Venezuela\'s former Socialist President Hugo Chavez.              "The markets and the productive sector see Duque as someone who guarantees the continuity of the current economic model, while they see Petro as someone who would break it down," said Carlos Sepulveda, dean of economics at Rosario University.               State-run oil company Ecopetrol SA is responsible for almost 60 percent of Colombia\'s oil production of around 830,000 barrels per day and operates export pipeline infrastructure.               Petro would shift its emphasis towards wind and solar power.                 "I really don\'t like either of them, but as I have to choose, it has to be Duque," said Carlos Mora, a 52-year-old lawyer. "With Petro, I really think we\'ll end up like Venezuela."              Some candidates from the first round have asked Colombians to cast blank ballots – a means for voters\' to demonstrate dissatisfaction with the choice of candidates.               Sergio Fajardo, nudged into third place by Petro last month, said on Friday neither Petro nor Duque represent a good option.              "The blank vote will be higher than usual because the two candidates are from the most extreme positions on right and left, leaving the moderate centrist electorate with no obvious option," said political analyst Yann Basset.

    title: "May pledges 20 billion extra pounds for healthcare post-Brexit",
    text:
      '              LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May pledged on Sunday to increase funding for the National Health Service (NHS) by 20 billion pounds after Brexit, partly from tax hikes and partly from money that will no longer be going to the European Union.              The announcement of more cash for the country\'s healthcare system, a regular issue at national elections, comes after a row in parliament over Brexit highlighted the fragility of May\'s minority government.              "By the end of five years, in 2023/24, the NHS will be getting 20 billion pounds more in real terms that year, than it is today," May said in a pre-recorded interview for LBC Radio broadcast on Sunday.              "We take the advantage that we\'ve got of the money we\'re no longer sending to the European Union, but also in putting the amount of money we want to put into the NHS for the future, I think we do have to look at contributing more."              Asked about tax increase, May said her finance minister  would set out plans before a government spending review expected next year. She said the increased contribution from taxpayers would be done in a "fair and balanced" way.              The announcement is timed to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS, which delivers free access to care for everyone living in Britain. It aims to foster unity in the government and the country after two years of bitter divisions over Brexit.              It was also tailored to send a positive message to the 48 percent of Britons who in 2016 wanted to remain in the EU - many of whom are still unconvinced about Brexit as the March 29, 2019 exit date approaches.              During the 2016 referendum campaign on EU membership, the pro-Brexit camp claimed that Britain was sending 350 million pounds a week to the EU and should spend that money on the NHS instead.              The claim was controversial because the figure did not take into account Britain\'s sizeable rebate or the payments that were flowing back from the EU to Britain, so it was widely seen as overstating Britain\'s contribution to the bloc.              Despite leaving, Britain will continue to make payments to the EU over several decades to settle an exit bill of around 39 billion pounds.              In her interview, May - who campaigned against Brexit in 2016 and has been under pressure from hardline Brexiteers ever since to prove her conversion to the cause - drew attention to the fact that her funding announcement exceeded that 350 million pound-per-week figure.              Twenty billion pounds annually is approximately 384 million pounds per week.              Jeremy Hunt, the health minister, who also campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU, was quoted by the Sunday Telegraph as saying that the new pledge "can now unite us all."

      "South Korea, U.S. to announce suspension of major military drills this week - Yonhap",
    text:
      '              By Josh Smith              SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea and the United States are expected to announce the suspension of "large-scale" military drills this week, with the provision that they would restart if North Korea failed to keep its promise to denuclearise, news agency Yonhap said on Sunday.              Citing an unnamed government source, the South Korean news agency said the suspension was likely to affect only major joint exercises, not more routine military training.              U.S. President Donald Trump surprised officials in Seoul and Washington when he pledged to end "war games" after his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore last week.              Immediately after the announcement, U.S. forces in Korea said they had received no guidance on stopping any drills, and South Korean officials said they were trying to figure out which exercises Trump was referring to.              However, in a sign Seoul may be open to suspending drills, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Thursday his government would need to be flexible when it came to applying military pressure on North Korea if it was sincere about denuclearisation.              Moon said South Korea would carefully consider joint military drills with the United States and he asked his officials to cooperate with the United States on the issue, his office said in a statement at the time.               Yonhap also reported on Sunday that during military talks between the two Koreas on Thursday, South Korean officials asked their northern counterparts to relocate artillery 30 to 40 kilometres away from the heavily fortified military demarcation line that divides the two countries.              The South\'s defence ministry denied it made such a request, Yonhap said.              The talks, the first in more than a decade, held in the border village of Panmunjom in the demilitarised zone (DMZ), followed an inter-Korean summit in April at which leaders of the two Koreas agreed to defuse tensions and cease "all hostile acts".              North and South Korea failed to reach any concrete agreement during those talks, officials said.              North Korea proposed to Seoul to disarm, on a trial basis, the Joint Security Area in Panmunjom, the only site in the DMZ where both countries\' soldiers stand almost face to face, the South\'s presidential spokesman said on Friday.              About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the Korean War, which ended in 1953 in an armistice that left the two Koreas technically still at war.              At a Senate hearing on Thursday, Trump\'s nominee to be ambassador to South Korea, retired Admiral Harry Harris, backed the idea of a "pause" in major military exercises. He said his understanding was that any suspension would involve only major military exercises and that regular training of U.S. forces in South Korea would continue, although final decisions were up to the Department of Defense.              The U.S.-South Korean exercise calendar hits a high point every year with the Foal Eagle and Max Thunder drills, which both wrapped up last month.              The next major drill, Ulchi Freedom Guardian, is planned for the end of the summer.              Last year, 17,500 American and more than 50,000 South Korean troops participated in the Ulchi Freedom Guardian drills, although the exercise is mostly focused on computerised simulations rather than live field exercises that use weapons, tanks or aircraft.

Dozens of Taliban militants entered the Afghan capital and other cities on Saturday to celebrate the end of the Ramadan fasting month. Soldiers and militants exchanged hugs and took selfies on their smartphones.              The peace council was set up to oversee the peace process. The news conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. (0530 GMT).               The Taliban announced a surprise three-day ceasefire over the Eid holiday, which began on Friday, except against foreign forces. It overlaps with an Afghan government ceasefire announced to run until Wednesday.              President Ashraf Ghani said in an address to the nation that he would extend the ceasefire. He also asked the Taliban to extend theirs and begin peace talks. He said he wanted to discuss "issues of mutual concern with neighbouring countries and the presence of foreign forces".              U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo echoed Ghani\'s remarks, saying peace talks would have to include a discussion on the role of "international actors and forces".              The United States wants Pakistan, which it accuses of harbouring Afghan Taliban commanders, to exert more influence on the group to bring it to the negotiating table.

      '              By Alonso Soto and Oswaldo Rivas              MANAGUA, Nicaragua (Reuters) - Eight people died on Saturday in a shoot-out and fire that shattered a truce struck hours earlier between President Daniel Ortega and protesters, and civic leaders condemned the violence while vowing to continue talks with the government.              Nicaragua\'s crisis, the country\'s bloodiest confrontations since a civil war ended in 1990, has spanned two months and claimed at least 170 lives. The unrest in the morning came hours after Ortega and protesters struck an agreement to end hostilities, clear roadblocks and allow a foreign inquiry.              Michael Healy, president of the agriculture producers union, blamed the government and law enforcement for the deaths of six people, including two children, as flames consumed their house in Managua after a confrontation with police. Two others died in the shoot-out.              "We were going to sleep in peace and tranquility. And what\'s sad was waking up to the death of this family, how they were burned," Healy said at the conclusion of talks with the government moderated by the Catholic church.               "The government wants us leave this table, and we\'re not going to let that happen... it\'s the only way to put an end to this," he added.              The dialogue proceeded as scheduled, with the government and civic leaders agreeing to set up working groups to debate proposals including democratic reforms, mediators said in a statement. Talks will resume on Monday.                   Responding to Saturday\'s unexpected flare-up, the national police in a statement attributed the morning\'s gunfire to protesters, and said two men had died.               Local media reported that police and pro-Ortega masked gunmen had fired at protesters guarding the roadblocks.              Police also said that firefighters battling the blaze came under attack from masked "delinquents," and that they would investigate the cause of the fire.               The government did not reply to a request for comment on the reports.              The head of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, said in a tweet that his organization "condemns this act of terror that is a crime against humanity."              Local television showed images of firemen carrying two soot-streaked toddlers in diapers from the burning building.              "This is a massacre. A barbarity. These police surrounded the house and burned it after my nephew refused to let them put snipers on the roof," Jose Maria Hernandez, 63, uncle of the building\'s owner who died in the blaze, told Reuters outside the smoking wreckage.              Ortega\'s surprise decision in April to slash pension benefits to cover a widening social security gap triggered demonstrations that quickly turned fatal and led to demands for his resignation.              The Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights said at least 170 people were killed in eight weeks of clashes between pro-Ortega forces armed with assault rifles and pistols and protesters armed with rocks, slings and homemade mortars.

      "Major fire ravages celebrated Glasgow School of Art for second time",
    text:
      '              By Russell Cheyne              GLASGOW, Scotland (Reuters) - A huge fire has gutted one of Scotland\'s architectural gems, the Mackintosh building at the Glasgow School of Art, which was still being restored after a major blaze in 2014.              Scotland\'s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said after visiting the site on Saturday that the damage to the 1909 masterpiece by Scottish designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh was "much, much worse" than four years ago.              "It\'s devastating," she told reporters. "Looking at it, it\'s a building that is just a shell."              The fire broke out late on Friday night, when the city centre was full of people enjoying a night out. Among them were many School of Art students celebrating their graduation, which took place earlier.              By the time fire crews were called to the scene the blaze had spread to the whole building.               Huge flames engulfed the Mackintosh, known locally as the Mack, and spread to adjacent buildings including a night club and a theatre, creating an orange glow over the city skyline.              More than 120 firefighters fought the blaze all night. The area was swiftly evacuated and no casualties were reported.              The Mackintosh building had been due to re-open next year after millions of pounds in restoration works following a fire in May 2014.              Sturgeon said it was too early to determine the cause of the fire, or to know whether the building would remain standing.              "All of us hope the building can be saved but it\'s too early to draw any conclusions," she said.              "The Scottish government stands ready to do anything we reasonably can to help ensure that the building has a future. It\'s too early to tell what that might entail, what it might look like."              By lunchtime on Saturday the blaze was under control, but firefighters were still at work trying to extinguish pockets of fire inside the building.              Charles Rennie Mackintosh, one of Scotland\'s most influential figures, inspired designers, architects and artists around Europe with his distinctive style.              The School of Art\'s website says the building named after him on Glasgow\'s Renfrew Street "heralded the birth of a new style in 20th century European architecture".              The British government\'s Scotland minister, David Mundell, said he was devastated by news of the fire.              "It is only a fortnight since I was there to see the progress on the restoration, and my heart goes out to all those who had worked so hard on that. The UK Government stands ready to help, financially or otherwise," he said in a statement.              Hundreds of people in Scotland and beyond took to social media to express their shock at news footage of the burning building, which some said was as symbolic for Glaswegians as Big Ben was for Londoners.              "It hurts, it actually hurts to watch it burn," wrote Scottish Twitter user Scott Galloway.              Many deplored what they called the cruel irony of the fire coming hours after a giant mural depicting Charles Rennie Mackintosh was unveiled elsewhere in Glasgow.               It features a portrait of Mackintosh looking through a stained-glass window featuring some of his designs.

      "Taxi ploughs into Moscow crowd including soccer fans, injuring seven",
    text:
      "              By Jack Stubbs, Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber and Maria Kiselyova              MOSCOW (Reuters) - A taxi drove into a crowd of pedestrians near Moscow's Red Square on Saturday, injuring seven people including two Mexicans in the city for the soccer World Cup which Russia is hosting, officials and eyewitnesses said.               The incident took place as residents and visiting soccer fans thronged the centre of Moscow on a balmy summer evening, a short distance from the Kremlin.               Moscow's traffic management authority said the taxi driver had a driver's licence issued in Kyrgyzstan, a mainly Muslim ex-Soviet republic. The driver, in custody, told police he had not driven into the crowd on purpose, according to a footage published on the Moscow police website.              Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said in a post on Twitter: \"There was an unpleasant incident with a taxi. The driver lost control of the vehicle.\"              The city's police said they had opened a criminal investigation into a suspected violation of the traffic code.              The police said seven people were injured in the incident. Moscow city's healthcare department said earlier that eight had been hurt and taken to hospital, of whom seven were in a satisfactory condition, while one woman was seriously hurt.              The Mexican embassy in Moscow said two Mexican women had been lightly injured. Also among those hurt were a Ukrainian, two Russians and two citizens of Azerbaijan, Russia's RIA news agency quoted a source in the emergency services as saying.               Video of the incident posted on social media showed the yellow Hyundai taxi pull sharply out of a line of stationary traffic, accelerate and mount the narrow pavement, which was packed with pedestrians.              The taxi drove for about 10 metres along the pavement, bowling over pedestrians and carrying some on the bonnet of the car. It came to a halt after hitting a traffic sign.              As bystanders tried to pull open the driver's side door, the driver, dressed in black trousers and black T-shirt, jumped out and sprinted away. More bystanders chased him and could be seen trying to tackle him as the footage ended.                            MEXICO SOCCER MATCH              A witness told Reuters that some of the people hit were wearing Mexican team colours. Mexico take on Germany on Sunday in their first World Cup match at Moscow's Luzhniki stadium, and thousands of Mexican fans are in the Russian capital.               A second witness told Reuters about the driver of the taxi: \"He was pulled out of the vehicle, he ran off but bystanders apprehended him. He was shouting: 'It wasn't me'.\"              Another witness, Viktoria Geraimovich, said she called emergency services on her mobile phone. She said the driver \"ran into a group of Mexicans. There were shouts, moans. He was only stopped because he hit a traffic sign.\"              \"Someone gave him a punch in the face. He stayed in the car, people came up to him, said what are you doing, punched him in the face, he opened the door and tried to run away.\"              \"It's scary that it was in the centre (of Moscow) and I was right opposite,\" she said.              Moscow's traffic management authority said the driver was not drunk and Interfax news agency cited a source saying there was no alcohol in his blood.              The driver said he wanted to brake but accidentally hit the accelerator instead, according to a video published by police.              \"I regret very much... I wanted to go home afterwards, to have a sleep,\" he said.              The driver said he had been working for 20 hours by the time the incident happened. Asked why he ran away, he said he was afraid he would be killed after bypassers beat him.                      A court will hold a sentencing hearing on Monday, TASS reported.              Authorities have vowed a safe soccer World Cup, which Russia is hosting for the first time ever. It is taking place in 11 cities until July 15.              In central Moscow, authorities have installed heavy concrete blocks across the entrances to pedestrian areas following a spate of incidents in European cities in which vehicles were used to mow down people.               The U.S. State Department on Friday updated its travel advice on Russia, saying terrorist groups were plotting  attacks.               \"Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities,\" the travel advice stated.                            DRIVER'S LICENCE              The Moscow traffic authority posted on Twitter a copy of what it said was the taxi driver's licence. It gave his name as Chingiz Anarbek Uulu and said he was born on April 22, 1990.               It gave his birthplace as the town of Kochkor-Ata in Kyrgyzstan, near the border with Uzbekistan.              An account on Russian social media platform Odnoklassniki for someone with the same name and date of birth was last updated two years ago.               The last video he posted on his page depicted chapter 82 of the Koran, Islam's holy book, which discussed judgement day. There was nothing on the page to suggest any links to, or sympathies with, Islamist militant groups.              People walking around in central Moscow on Saturday evening said they were aware of the taxi incident, but it did not put them off spending time in the city. The streets were packed with people listening to street musicians perform, or sitting at pavement cafes.              \"We're not scared but disappointed,\" said Youseff Fraige, 27, from Monterrey, Mexico.               \"We didn't expect something like this to happen in a place like this. It could happen anywhere in the world, but that it happens here in Moscow, in the middle of the World Cup, it's shocking for us.\"                             (Reporting by Christian Lowe, Maria Kiselyova, Jack Stubbs, Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber and Tom Balmforth; Writing by Christian Lowe; Editing by Stephen Powell, Catherine Evans and David Gregorio)                                          "

      '              By Alonso Soto and Oswaldo Rivas              MANAGUA, Nicaragua (Reuters) - Eight people died on Saturday in a shoot-out and fire that shattered a truce struck hours earlier between President Daniel Ortega and protesters, and civic leaders condemned the violence while vowing to continue talks with the government.              Nicaragua\'s crisis, the country\'s bloodiest confrontations since a civil war ended in 1990, has spanned two months and claimed at least 170 lives. The unrest in the morning came hours after Ortega and protesters struck an agreement to end hostilities, clear roadblocks and allow a foreign inquiry.              Michael Healy, president of the agriculture producers union, blamed the government and law enforcement for the deaths of six people, including two children, as flames consumed their house in Managua after a confrontation with police. Two others died in the shoot-out.              "We were going to sleep in peace and tranquillity. And what\'s sad was waking up to the death of this family, how they were burned," Healy said at the conclusion of talks with the government moderated by the Catholic church.               "The government wants us leave this table, and we\'re not going to let that happen... it\'s the only way to put an end to this," he added.

      "Merkel seeks EU migrant talks as German coalition crisis looms - paper",
    text:
      "              BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel, struggling to avert a crisis within her coalition on migrant policy, is trying to set up a meeting of some EU states to discuss the issue before a leaders summit on June 28-29, a German newspaper reported on Sunday.              Citing government sources from representatives of several EU states, top-selling Bild reported on its website that Merkel wanted to discuss possible solutions with Greece, Italy and Austria.              \"It is not yet agreed, we are in the planning phase. It is also unclear exactly when this special summit would take place,\" a member of the Italian government told Bild. The paper added that next weekend might be one possibility.              A German government spokesperson was not immediately available to comment on the report.              EU states are deeply divided on how to deal with large numbers of people fleeing conflict, especially from the Middle East. The issue has come to a head in the last week with a new Italian government refusing to let a ship carrying hundreds of migrants dock at its ports.               Merkel is adamant that migrant policy can only be effectively agreed and implemented at the European level and is at loggerheads with her own conservative Bavarian allies and her  Interior Minister who want unilateral action.              The Bavarians have threatened to defy Merkel and on Monday go ahead with plans which she has sought to block. Under the minister's proposal, Germany would send back migrants who have already registered in other EU countries.               This would undermine Merkel's authority as it represents a reversal of her 2015 open-door approach, and would also be a blow to the EU's Schengen open-border system.              Merkel has asked the Bavarian conservatives to give her two weeks to come up with bilateral deals with some countries, like Italy and Greece, similar to one agreed between Turkey and the EU in 2016.               Bild said it was unclear whether Spain and other countries from the Balkans would take part in Merkel's meeting.
